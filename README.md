I am the chief technical officer for World eSports LLC. I have worked on several developmental projects and some that I cannot divulge. However, I can talk about <a href="https://worldesports.app">World eSports Website</a>. It was created to help smaller leagues around the world better manage their sports leagues and teams! 
<br>
We offer several key features including but not limited to; drafting, scheduling, rosters, automated forms, proprietary dashboards, proprietary team & player pages and much more!
<br>
I have listed some of our work below. If you are interested in having your website programmed or need developmental help you can email us at the link below!
